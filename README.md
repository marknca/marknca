## Hello!

Pronounced /mɑː(r)k/ 😉

Trying not to 🤦‍♂️, sometimes actually succeeding.

### Code
Repos here contain a mismash of personal projects, repos I've contributed to, and the standard code 👻 graveyard of **projects with good intentions**.

### My Work
If you want to know more [about](https://markn.ca/about) me check out my site, I post regularly on cloud, devops, and the modernization of security. 

### Let's Chat
I'm available on Twitter (where [I'm @marknca](https://markn.ca)) or via [email](mailto:me@markn.ca), if you want to chat.
