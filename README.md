## Hello!

Trying not to 🤦‍♂️, sometimes actually succeeding.

Code here is a mismash of personal projects, repos I've contributed to, and the standard code 👻 graveyard of **projects with good intentions**.

If you want to know more [about](https://markn.ca/about) me check out my site, I post regularly on cloud, devops, and the moderninzation of security.
